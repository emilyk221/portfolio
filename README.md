  ## Description
  This app is built with React and therefore takes advantage of a single-page application format. In practice, this translates to faster load times because the entire page doesn't reload when navigating around but rather only changed sections are rewritten to the page. I built this app to demonstrate my web development abilities and showcase some of the projects I've worked on recently.
